<h1>Spherical Chess</h1>
The idea is to turn the chess board into a sphere, the sphere contains the same grid as the chess board except at the end where the squares are warped into triangles and the rules have also changed a bit. Now that the board wraps around itself some moves which allow the piece to travel as far as it can now allow it to go all round the board, for e.g. a Bishop can now travel in an entire loop around the board.
